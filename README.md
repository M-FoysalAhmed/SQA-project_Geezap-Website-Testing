# Geezap Website Testing – SQA Project

This repository contains Software Quality Assurance (SQA) documentation and testing activities conducted on the **Geezap** website — an online job portal platform currently in the development phase.

The primary goal of this project was to test the core functionalities, identify bugs, and document test cases that ensure the platform’s quality and usability before public release.

#### Project Objectives

- Perform **exploratory testing** to detect early-stage issues
- Design and execute **manual test cases** for key modules
- Identify and document **functional and UI-related bugs**
- Create a **test checklist** to track validation status

---

#### Key Activities

- Explored user flows like login, registration, and job browsing
- Verified field validations, page navigation, and input behaviors
- Logged bugs with clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity levels
- Developed structured test cases for critical paths and edge cases
